## Overview and Origin
---
Ascent, a Chicago based company in the RegTech domain, was founded in 2015 by Brian Clark. This came after the 2008 crash when the government placed complicated regulations on companies in response to incomprehensive compliance practices pre-crash. These complicated regulations sparked the idea to create a solution to abide by the government's new standards. Thus, using artificial intelligence to gather regulation documentation and and “automate regulatory compliance, to reduce both risk and the cost to comply,” (https://www.ascentregtech.com/about-us/). Ascent is funded by “by Drive Capital. ING, Wells Fargo, Alsop Louie and The University of Chicago also participated. Ascent’s total funding is $26.7 million, according to Crunchbase, including a $6 million Series A raised in 2018,”
[(https://www.builtinchicago.org/2019/11/05/ascent-raises-19m). Ascent successfully gained Seed, Series A, and Series B funding, which carried the bulk of it at $19.3M. This allowed it to expand into new locations and industries.

## Business Activities
---
Ascent's goal is to reduce risk and make compliance simpler. It uses AI to gather regulatory updates in real-time so companies can rely on accurate, automated compliance with fewer human errors.
Ascent primarily services financial firms, such as ING, Commonwealth Bank, Bremer Bank, and RCM Alternatives. ING services 38.4 million customers, including both corporate clients and financial institutions; therefore Ascent is a market leader in RegTech for the financial industry. 
(https://www.ascentregtech.com/). While Ascent does not have the highest funding in its market, like other of its competitors, MetricStream at $240M and Calypso at $232M for example, Ascent does offer a solution these giants do not. Ascent has the highest accuracy in data output at 99.5%. As this company is centralized in Chicago and focused on this location, they can assure the accuracy of their real-time information and regulatory updates. 

As mentioned, Ascent uses Artificial Intelligence as the basis of its approach to compliance solutions. They have their own technology, RegulationAI, marketed as “...the expertise of a human at the speed of a machine.” They describe it as such, “Validated and trained by in-house legal and compliance experts, our world-class algorithms ingest, parse, and analyze millions of lines of regulatory text in order to deliver the insights that matter to you. The result? A complete inventory of regulatory obligations – targeted to your business, detailed down to the line of regulation, and always up-to-date,” (https://www.ascentregtech.com/our-approach/). Ascent has recently integrated with IBM, allowing clients to enter their regulatory obligations directly into IBM’s OpenPages with Watson. This ensures lower risk via increased compliance (https://www.ascentregtech.com/blog/ascent-ibm-integrate-ai-regtech-solutions/).

## Landscape
---
While Ascent itself provides Knowledge-as-a-Service within the RegTech domain, they service Financial Services Firms as they are most prone to compliance errors, due to the ever changing regulations (https://www.ascentregtech.com/blog/ascent-ibm-integrate-ai-regtech-solutions/).
A few major trends and innovations have been occuring over the last few years in RegTech as it relates to Financial services. First, cloud is at the core of compliance. Cloud will allow information to be shared and consistantly up-to-date.
RegTech is allowing institutions to see how new regulations will impact their business as well as the converse, allowing authorities to make more strategic decisions. Banking compliance is often subject to fraud, which is substantially minimized by RegTech.
RegTech has also broken into the tax territory. "It will help... identify the tax rules and predict the investment patterns, which can prove to be a wealth management insight." Lastly, risk management is much easier to manage across borders. "[It] will offer a unified interface to monitor cross border financial and other business activities," (https://globalfintechseries.com/ten-ways-regtech-innovations-will-change-or-solve-compliance-and-regulatory-issues/).
As mentioned, the two larger companies in this domain are MetricStream and Calypso, based on funding, employees, and revenue. The largest difference between Ascent and these two huge market-players, is the ability to service internationally. Other smaller companies, like AQMetrics and LogicGate, function similarly to Ascent, using their own cloud based AI to gather real-time regulations. The major difference here, is that each company has their own algorithmic model.
